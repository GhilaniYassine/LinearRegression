Collecting workspace information

Based on the workspace content, I'll help you create a README.md file that explains the Linear Regression project. Here's a suggested README:

Linear Regression Model with PyTorch
A simple implementation of linear regression using PyTorch to predict values based on the equation y = ax + b.

Overview
This project demonstrates:

Building a basic linear regression model using PyTorch's nn.Module
Training the model on synthetic data
Evaluating model performance
Saving and loading model weights
Model Architecture
The model is defined in the LinearRegressionM class which:

Inherits from nn.Module
Has two learnable parameters:
a: slope parameter
b: bias parameter
Implements the linear equation y = ax + b in the forward pass
Training
The model is trained with:

Loss function: nn.L1Loss()
Optimizer: SGD with learning rate 0.01
Number of epochs: 1000

# Create model instance
model = LinearRegressionM()

# Train model
for epoch in range(epochs):
    y_pred = model(x_train)
    loss = loss_fn(y_pred, y_train)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()

# Save model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'models/linearRM.pth')

# Load model
loaded_model = LinearRegressionM()
loaded_model.load_state_dict(torch.load('models/linearRM.pth'))

Results
The model achieves:

Final training loss: ~0.003
Final test loss: ~0.012
Learns parameters close to the true values (a=0.3, b=0.7)
Usage
Visualizations
The project includes plotting functionality to visualize:

Training data
Test data
Model predictions
Requirements
PyTorch
Matplotlib
Python 3.x
The model demonstrates successful learning of the underlying linear relationship in the synthetic data.
